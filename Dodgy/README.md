# About Dodgy
1. This game is built using the **C# programming language**, it uses **Unity** as its Game Engine.
2. The game loop is pretty simple, it is to move from **start to finish**, while ***avoiding*** as many obstacles as possible.
3. The obstacles respond to collisions by changing their color from the default, to red.
4. The obstacles used are **Prefabs** of the following categories.
	- Cube (for spinners, static obstacles and droppers)
	- Sphere (for rollers)
(these prefabs use rigidBody and box collider based functions and mechanics, to react to the player input)

*(This is my first try with 3D games in unity, I hope to increase my knowledge base for unity 3D by practicing building these kind of games)*
[This game is based on the game idea and tutorial provided from udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/)
